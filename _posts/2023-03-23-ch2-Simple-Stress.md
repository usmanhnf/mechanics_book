#### Simple Stress

Mechanics is the study of the behavior of bodies subject to forces and displacements (and, to some extent, heating and cooling). Solid Mechanics (or Mechanics of Solids) deals specifically with “solid bodies”.

#### Body
For the purpose of Mechanics, a body is a portion of matter that, at a given moment in time, occupies a certain region in space. For example, A car on the road, a rocket in the space, a bridge supported on the supports.

---

#### Particle
If the region occupied by the body can be idealized as being of negligible extent (and thus reducible to a point), the body is called a particle.

#### Finite Body
A body that is not reducible to a single particle will be called a finite body.

---

#### Continuum
A finite body occupying a connected region every portion of which contains some matter is called a continuous body or, simply, a continuum. But at any point in a region occupied by a continuum, the matter in its immediate (infinitesimal) neighborhood can also be thought of as constituting a particle, and we may thus speak of the particles (also called material points) of a continuum.

#### Displacement
A body is said to undergo a displacement when some or all of its particles are moved to occupy different positions in space.


##### Configuration
The correspondence between the particles and the positions occupied by them at a given time is known as the body’s configuration. (For example, initial configuration, final configuration).
##### Rigid Displacement
The displacement of a body is said to be rigid if the distances between all pairs of particles are the same in any two configurations. Bodies that undergo rigid displacement are rigid bodies.
##### Deformation
The body is said to undergo deformation if the distances between all pairs of particles are not the same in any two configurations. Bodies that go deformation are deformable bodies.

#### Motion
Motion is said to occur when the body occupies a succession of different configurations continuously over time.
##### Rigid Motion
rigid motion is a motion that involves only rigid displacements. The rate of change, in time, of the position of a particle is its velocity. The velocity may in turn change in time, and its rate of change is the acceleration. The motion of a body is called uniform if the acceleration of all the particles is zero; otherwise, it is called accelerated. The branch of mechanics dealing with the displacement and motion of bodies is called kinematics.

#### Forces
Forces are interactions between bodies that cause them to move, and more specifically to accelerate, relative to each other (unless prevented from doing so by other forces).

> ##### Gravitational Field
>
> All bodies on or near the earth are subject to the earth’s gravitational force and, according to Galilieo, will fall toward the center of the earth (unless prevented from doing so by other forces) with the same acceleration; the magnitude of this acceleration is denoted by g. Later, Newton showed that the magnitude of the acceleration (with respect to a frame of reference based on the “fixed” stars) due to gravitational force between any two bodies (idealized as particles) is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, and for each body it is proportional to the quantity of matter (or mass) of the other body. The product of mass and acceleration is therefore equal and opposite for the two bodies and may be identified with the force exerted on each body by the other.

#### Equilibrium
If a body’s acceleration is zero, then it is at rest or in a uniform motion. In this case, the forces are said to be in equilibrium. The study of equilibrium is known as statics and constitutes mostly in this course.

> From the concept of equilibrium, the topics in ME-106 Engineering Mechanics course fit into the framework of Mechanics. You have used “equilibrium” as the most fundamental attribute to solving statics problems.

#### Concept Questions

> The topic of friction in the last course applies knowledge of rigid/deformable bodies. Are those rigid/deformable bodies actually rigid/deformable?
>
> During analysis of the trusses for finding member forces, what kind of deformation you expect in the truss members. 
>
> Once you have analyzed a truss and found all the member forces, is it understood that the members of the truss are steel members, or perhaps wooden members?
> 
> A simply supported beam can describe a bridge, and a person standing on the bridge can be defined as a point load. Is the bridge a deformable body or a rigid body? 
> 
> Can you give any example of deformation in the previous course?
